# mathbio-primer
Welcome to my mathematical biology primer course! The hope is that by completing this course, you will have the basic skills required to start tackling quantitative research papers you may be interested in, in whatever subfield of biology you may be interested in.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Who are you? Why did you make this?
Hi, I’m Thea! I recently graduated with a BSc in Mathematics with Applied Mathematics from Imperial College London, and I’m now continuing my studies there with an MRes in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology.

Throughout my degree, I shaped my education around **mathematical biology**, exploring how maths is used to answer biological questions. Over time, I noticed how scattered the resources in this area can be, and how challenging it can be to find a clear entry point, especially for budding mathematicians.

That’s why I decided to put together this “primer course” - a short, exploratory overview of what I believe are the key concepts essential to progressing in this interdisciplinary field. My hope is that it serves as a useful starting point for anyone curious about the intersection of maths and biology, whether you’re just beginning or looking to deepen your understanding.

### Who is this for?
This was designed specifically for my Department of Life Sciences friends taking **LIFE60052 Integrative Systems Biology**, and my **Directed Reading Programme Group** members (2025-2026) in the Department of Mathematics. HOWEVER!

I've designed this course for both biological and physical scientists. Due to the nature of the content (and my background), this means that the split is still roughly 70-30 in favour of the mathematics, but I believe that enough exposition is provided on either end so that this course is enjoyable for everyone. Further reading will also be provided if the main resources aren't doing it for you.

In terms of difficulty, this course is designed to be as "from scratch" as is possible. As an overview of the content, 

### How long will it take to complete?
At the time of writing, I have designed the course to take roughly 10 weeks to complete under my supervision. If you're using this for self-study, this number may be higher - take as long as you want on each section!

### Are there any relevant resources you'd recommend as supplementary reading?
Of course! In writing this course, I "took inspiration from my past lecturers", who also "took inspiration" from many textbooks. Some of them are listed below:
#### Reading List
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*, Strogatz
- *An Introduction to Systems Biology*, Alon
